<h1 id="publication-manifest-processing">Publication Manifest Processing</h1>
<p>This is a proof-of-concept implementation, in Typescript and on top of <code>node.js</code>, of processing a <a href="https://w3c.github.io/pub-manifest">Publication Manifest</a> into an implementation of the finals “map” (i.e., a Typescript class instance), as described in <a href="https://w3c.github.io/pub-manifest/#manifest-processing">§4 of the Publication Manifest specification</a>.</p>
<p>It is <em>not</em> a meaningful implementation insofar as it could be embedded in a full-blown Pub Manifest based User Agent implementation right away. Its main purpose is to check the correctness of the specification itself. In particular, it does not have a proper user interface and only a rudimentary command line interface.</p>
<p>The (only) API function is described in the <a href="./doc/">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Status 2019-10-27: the implementation is there, but not yet fully tested.</p>
