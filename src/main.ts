/**
 * Implementation (with minor omission, see comments) of the Processing steps as defined in
 * [ยง4 of the Publication Manifest](https://www.w3.org/TR/pub-manifest/#manifest-processing).
 *
 * Because the primary goal of all this is checking the processing algorithm,
 * there is (currently) no implementation of the extraction from an HTML file or handling extensions. Accordingly,
 * the "Add HTML Defaults" step ([ยง4.4.3](https://www.w3.org/TR/pub-manifest/#dfn-add-html-defaults)) is not implemented either.
 *
 * Implementation specificities:
 *
 * - when the document says 'failure is returned', this appears in the code as returning the Javascript value `undefined` or, when the function returns a boolean, `false`.
 * - the 'context' is implemented via one of the `*_Impl` class instances corresponding to the TS Interface definitions for the internal representations. All these classes have a reference to a [[Terms]] instance that classifies the terms defined for that class (type).
 * Note, however, that the HTML related functions (e.g., extracting `<title>`) is _not_ implemented
 * at this point.
 *
 * Also, the implementation is a bit more complicated than it would be in Javascript, mainly due to the requirements of Typescript.
 * For example, the original object, parsed from JSON, cannot be directly modified and returned as `processed`; instead, Typescript classes, duly defined as
 * implementing the Typescript interfaces, must be created with the key/values set.
 *
 * This module is just a simple entry point, providing a rudimentary CLI.
