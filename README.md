# Testing the Publication Manifest Processing Algorithm details

This is a proof-of-concept implementation, in Typescript on top of `node.js`, of the processing of a [Publication Manifest](https://w3c.github.io/pub-manifest) into an implementation of the [WebIDL interface](https://w3c.github.io/pub-manifest/#webidl).

At the moment, this is highly experimental; it is also a way for me to learn TypeScript...

It is all a first run, I am sure there are bugs or missing features:-)
